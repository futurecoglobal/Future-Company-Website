# Future-Co-Website

# Things to point out

**_I do undestand that the design is made for particular circumstances, however, currently we should stick to the content we can provide and avoid self-contradictions_**

## Inside team.html (the team page)

    1- Having a view all button besides the "OUR TEAM" header seems pretty redundant.
    2- Privacy - terms at the VERY bottom of the page. Do we have terms and privacy statement? If not, then it shouldn't be put there

## General notes

    1- I think the footer's too big. We should reduce the size.
    2- Should we remove the download the pitch deck button?
    3- As of now, I'll be working on the website mostly alone. Might talk to Yeasin and have him work on the website.

## Updates on the team

**It is with massive sadness that I have to report that it'd be best if we look for other developers other than the ones we currently have. So far, they have contributed a bit to the website which is SUPPOSED to be an easy task. However, after the many chances and attempts that I have given they still failed. I recommend getting some other developers for the start-up so that we can ensure a smooth execution**
